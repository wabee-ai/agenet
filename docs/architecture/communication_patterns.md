# Communication Patterns

Agenet leverages several communication patterns to ensure reliable, scalable, and efficient message routing and processing across clients and agents. These patterns define how requests are routed, handled, and responded to within the system.

## Core Communication Patterns

### 1. UUID-Based Response Routing
Each request initiated by a client is assigned a unique identifier (UUID) if not already provided. This UUID serves as a dedicated response channel, ensuring that each response is correctly matched with its originating request. This pattern prevents message collisions and enables precise response tracking.

- **Purpose**: Isolate and track responses to specific client requests.
- **Benefit**: Allows reliable message handling by uniquely associating responses with individual client requests.

### 2. Bidirectional gRPC Streams
Agenet utilizes bidirectional gRPC streams to maintain an open, real-time communication channel between clients and the system. This pattern enables clients to send requests and receive responses continuously without re-establishing connections, which is crucial for systems requiring low latency and high responsiveness.

- **Purpose**: Maintain a persistent, low-latency connection between clients and Agenet.
- **Benefit**: Enables real-time interaction with minimal connection overhead, allowing for a seamless flow of requests and responses.

### 3. Request-Based Routing
Within Agenet, requests are dynamically routed to the appropriate agent based on predefined request channels. The Dispatcher directs these requests to the corresponding agent, ensuring each request is processed by the intended handler.

- **Purpose**: Direct client requests to the correct processing agent.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies client interactions by handling routing logic within the system, allowing agents to handle specific requests efficiently.

### 4. Persistent Response Channels
Upon receiving a request, the Gateway establishes a connection to a dedicated response channel tied to the requestâ€™s UUID. This connection persists until the response is delivered, ensuring that no message is lost even in cases of temporary disconnection.

- **Purpose**: Ensure reliable message delivery and response persistence.
- **Benefit**: Enhances message resilience, allowing Agenet to handle temporary network issues without impacting client experience.

These patterns together enable Agenet to maintain a robust and flexible messaging infrastructure, where each component (Gateway, Dispatcher, and Agent) operates within clearly defined channels, ensuring efficient and accurate message delivery.
