# Component Specifications

Each component in Agenet plays a distinct role in facilitating efficient request routing, processing, and response delivery. This section outlines the core functionalities and specifications for each component.

## Gateway

The **Gateway** acts as the entry point for all client requests. It is responsible for assigning a unique UUID to each request (if not provided), routing requests to the appropriate Request Channels, and establishing a response channel for each request.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receives incoming client requests.
  - Generates and assigns UUIDs to requests for unique identification.
  - Routes requests to the designated Request Channels.
  - Establishes and listens on a UUID-based Response Channel for each request to receive responses.

- **Key Functions**:
  - **Request Reception**: Handles incoming gRPC requests from clients and initializes the processing cycle.
  - **UUID Generation**: Ensures each request has a unique identifier for tracking purposes.
  - **Channel Management**: Manages connections to both Request and Response Channels.

## Dispatcher

The **Dispatcher** is the component that coordinates between the Gateway and Agents. It connects to specific Request Channels and forwards requests to the corresponding Agents for processing.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Listens on Request Channels for incoming client requests.
  - Directs requests to the appropriate Agent based on the RequestType.
  - Ensures the response from the Agent is routed back through the Response Channel associated with the UUID.

- **Key Functions**:
  - **Request Forwarding**: Routes each request from the Gateway to the appropriate Agent.
  - **Response Routing**: Returns the processed response from the Agent to the correct Response Channel for the Gateway to retrieve.

## Agent

The **Agent** is responsible for handling and executing specific types of requests, based on its assigned responsibilities. Each Agent is specialized to handle one or more types of requests and return the processed results.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Processes requests received from the Dispatcher based on the RequestType.
  - Performs the necessary operations (e.g., file retrieval, data update).
  - Sends the response back through the Dispatcher to complete the request cycle.

- **Key Functions**:
  - **Request Processing**: Executes tasks related to the clientâ€™s request.
  - **Response Generation**: Prepares and returns responses, which are routed back to the Gateway via the Dispatcher.

This modular design ensures that each component has a clearly defined role, enabling Agenet to efficiently route and process requests in a scalable, resilient manner.
