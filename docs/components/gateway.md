# Gateway Component

The **Gateway** component in Agenet serves as the main entry point for client requests, abstracting the complexity of routing and handling communications within the system. It maintains a **bidirectional gRPC stream** with each client, enabling real-time request handling and response delivery.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Establishing a Bidirectional gRPC Stream with the Client
When a client connects to the Gateway, a bidirectional gRPC stream is opened. This stream allows the client to send requests and receive responses in real time. The Gateway handles each request as it arrives on the stream and sends responses back on the same connection, providing a seamless communication channel.

### 2. Request Reception and UUID Generation
When the Gateway receives a request from a client over the gRPC stream, it checks if a UUID (unique identifier) is provided. If not, it generates one. This UUID uniquely identifies the request throughout the system, enabling precise response tracking and preventing message collisions.

### 3. Request Routing by RequestType
The Gateway uses the **RequestType** provided in the client’s request to determine the correct processing path within Agenet. Each RequestType corresponds to a specific service or function within the system, such as retrieving a file or updating an order.

- **RequestType Structure**: To keep routing organized, each request type defines a specific category, such as `"retrieve_file"` or `"update_order"`, which helps the Gateway identify the appropriate processing agent.

### 4. Establishing a Response Channel
Once the request is routed, the Gateway establishes a unique response channel linked to the UUID. This channel ensures that responses are routed back to the correct client, maintaining a persistent connection until the request is fully processed.

## Example Request Format

To clarify the structure of a client request, here is an example JSON payload that the Gateway might receive:

```json
{
    "uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "requestType": "retrieve_file",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "data": {
        "filePath": "/path/to/file.txt",
        "options": {
            "readOnly": true,
            "cache": false
        }
    },
    "metadata": {
        "clientId": "12345",
        "timestamp": "2024-11-06T15:30:00Z"
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Fields

- **uuid**: A unique identifier for the request. If not provided by the client, the Gateway generates one automatically.
- **requestType**: Specifies the type of request, helping the Gateway route it to the correct processing path. Examples include `"retrieve_file"` and `"update_order"`.
- **content-type**: Defines the format of the `data` field, such as `"application/json"` or `"text/plain"`.
- **data**: Contains the main payload of the request, which is structured according to the specific request type.
- **metadata**: Includes additional information about the request, such as the `clientId` and timestamp.

## Example Workflow

Below is a high-level example flow demonstrating how the Gateway manages a "Retrieve File" request:

1. **Client** establishes a bidirectional gRPC stream with the **Gateway** and sends a `"Retrieve File"` request with a specified RequestType and (optionally) a UUID.
2. **Gateway** generates a UUID for the request if none is provided and assigns a timestamp to the request for tracking.
3. **Gateway** identifies the request as `"retrieve_file"` and routes it to the appropriate internal channel for processing.
4. **Gateway** establishes a response channel associated with the UUID to listen for the result.
5. **System Processing**: The request is processed internally, and once complete, a response is directed back to the Gateway’s response channel.
6. **Gateway** retrieves the response and sends it back to the client over the gRPC stream, completing the request lifecycle.

## Benefits of the Gateway's Role in Agenet

- **Simplified Client Interaction**: By abstracting the routing complexity, the Gateway allows clients to focus solely on their requests without needing to know internal processing details.
- **Enhanced Request Tracking**: UUIDs provide a secure and precise method for tracking requests, reducing the risk of message loss or misrouting.
- **Real-Time, Resilient Communication**: The bidirectional gRPC stream provides seamless, real-time communication between client and Gateway, enabling prompt request handling and response delivery.
- **Adaptable to Infrastructure**: The Gateway's design is flexible and can operate across different messaging platforms, supporting scalability and adaptability.

The Gateway component enables Agenet to handle large-scale request routing and response management with efficiency and resilience, ensuring a smooth client experience.
