# Purpose

Agenet, or **Agent Network**, serves as a flexible routing system that allows clients to send specific requests without needing knowledge of the underlying infrastructure or dependencies.

## Key Purpose of Agenet
- **Simplified Client Integration**: Agenet enables clients to send and receive requests without directly interacting with specific services. This abstraction allows the client applications to remain lightweight and decoupled from the service architecture.
- **Modular and Scalable Design**: By separating client interactions from service-specific logic, Agenet promotes a highly modular and scalable system that can grow and adapt with minimal disruption to existing clients or agents.
- **Seamless Communication between Clients and Agents**: Agenet manages the complexities of routing, processing, and responding to client requests, allowing both clients and agents to focus on their core responsibilities.

Agenetâ€™s purpose is to provide a robust solution for managing asynchronous requests in real-time, empowering a diverse ecosystem of services to communicate efficiently within a unified framework.
