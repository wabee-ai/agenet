# Agenet - Agent Network

## Introduction
Agenet, short for **Agent Network**, is inspired by Usenet's concept of a **User Network**. Just as Usenet created a vast, decentralized system for sharing information between users, Agenet is designed to facilitate seamless communication and task routing among service agents. This system enables clients to send specific requests without needing knowledge of underlying dependencies, service locations, or infrastructure.

Agenet promotes a modular, decoupled, and scalable architecture where each service is independently developed, managed, and maintained. Through this network, clients and agents communicate efficiently, focusing solely on requests while Agenet handles all complexities of routing, processing, and response.
